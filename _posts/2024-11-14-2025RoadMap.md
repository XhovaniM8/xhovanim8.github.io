# 2025 - Road Map

## Introduction

Within a year from now I will most likely be graduating from New York University with a Master's degree in Computer Engineering. Mark Manson wrote an article about the four stages of life being:

1. Mimicry
2. Self-Discovery
3. Commitment
4. Legacy

I'm somewhere in between Self-Discovery and Commitment (let's say 75%/25% respectively). But as I get older, I want to focus on committing to being
serviceable at computer engineering. I can't imagine the bell curve of employability for a 25 year old with a Master's in Computer Engineering 
but according to NYU, the median salary is around 110k with around 91% employed after 3-months post graduation.  I chose to get a bachelor's in it because I had a technological green thumb? A green thumbdrive? I also wanted the career safety.
Well I'll tell you there is no career safety if you're mediocre so that doesn't matter. 

I'm making a roadmap of things I want scope in on at my last year at NYU before I graduate.
