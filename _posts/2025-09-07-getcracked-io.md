## What Is GetCracked.io?

[GetCracked.io](https://www.getcracked.io) is a technical interview prep platform with **600+ coding questions** focused on quant, trading, and systems roles. It covers OS, computer architecture, concurrency, networking, and practical coding—not just DSA puzzles.

The site was built by "Coding Jesus," the quant-focused YouTuber who blew up on TikTok and Instagram this year. He's actively developing it and adding new content regularly.

I've talked to him personally—he's a chill dude. The rage bait content is just for engagement (and it works), but behind the scenes he's serious about the product. The website is well-designed and gets constant updates.

## Who It's For

- Quant trading firm candidates (Jane Street, Citadel, etc.)
- HFT and systems programming roles
- Anyone facing a "knowledge round" beyond standard LeetCode

If you're just doing generic SWE interviews at mid-tier companies, LeetCode is probably fine. This is for when they start asking about cache coherence and false sharing.

---

## Key Features

- **Question library**: Language fundamentals, OS, architecture, networking, concurrency, design patterns, and practical C++ problems.
- **Filtering**: Sort by topic, difficulty, and company patterns (premium feature).
- **Performance tracking**: Dashboard with rankings, success rates, and percentile benchmarks.
- **Behavioral prep**: Video guides for soft skills and salary negotiation.
- **Discord access**: Community with other candidates and people who've landed offers.

## Pricing

| Plan | Price | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Free | $0 | Basic questions, can earn money contributing |
| Premium | $20/month | Full access, video guides, advanced filtering |
| Lifetime | $299 once | Everything forever, no recurring fees |

The lifetime plan is the move if you're serious about prep.

## Does It Actually Work?

The site has real testimonials. Some highlights:

- $600K+ TC at a tier-1 quant firm—guy credited the CPU architecture and cache content
- Two competing $400K+ offers for someone pivoting from cloud to low-level systems
- Undergrad landed $175/hour internship at a trading firm, interviewer called him "one of the most technically impressive undergraduates" for systems knowledge
- Big-tech engineer got an out-of-band offer at a quant firm, $250K base / ~$485K guaranteed TC

Take testimonials with a grain of salt, but these are specific and verifiable through their Discord.

## How It Compares

Most platforms (LeetCode, NeetCode, AlgoExpert) focus on DSA. GetCracked covers what those don't: OS internals, computer architecture, concurrency patterns, and practical implementation questions like "implement a shared pointer with move semantics."

If you've ever bombed an interview because they asked about false sharing or cache line alignment, this fills that gap.

---

## Trust & Legitimacy

- ScamAdviser trust score: **76/100**
- Active development with regular new questions
- Works fine for me, no issues

---

## Verdict

**What's good:**
- Covers topics other platforms ignore
- Progress tracking with real analytics
- Reasonable pricing, especially lifetime
- Honestly kind of addicting

**What's meh:**
- Smaller question bank than LeetCode (but more focused)
- Premium required for best features

---

## Summary

GetCracked.io is solid for quant and systems interview prep. If you're targeting roles where they care about low-level knowledge beyond inverting binary trees, it's worth the price.

The **$299 lifetime plan** is the best value if you're in it for the long haul.
