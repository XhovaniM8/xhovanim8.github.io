# Project: Building a UDP Communication System with FPGA and Macbook

## Project Goal

1. **Develop a UDP Server in C++**
2. **Implement a UDP Client in Verilog for hardware interaction.**
3. **Establish a communication channel to send a string from the server to the client.**

These initial steps will lay the foundation for optimizing data transfer speed, setting the groundwork for integration into the eventual HFT-lite project. 

## Implementation Plan

Since programming an FPGA with Vivado on a Macbook is not feasible, the initial focus will be on implementing the UDP Client on the FPGA. Subsequently, the UDP Server will be developed on the Macbook to test the communication channel.

## Specifications

- **Macbook Pro (Apple Silicon) + CLion for UDP Client**
- **Windows 10 + Vivado for UDP Server**
- **Digilent Arty S7-50 FPGA (Spartan 7)**
- **5-Port Gigabit Ethernet Switch (TL-SG105) for communication between the Macbook and FPGA**

## FPGA UDP Client

The FPGA UDP Client is a critical component in establishing communication with the Macbook UDP Server. This section will delve into the specifics of implementing the UDP Client on the Digilent Arty S7-50 FPGA.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Setting Up the FPGA Environment**
   - Install necessary tools and libraries on Windows, including Vivado.
   - Connect the Digilent Arty S7-50 FPGA to the Windows machine.

2. **Verilog Code for UDP Client**
   - Develop Verilog code to initialize the FPGA as a UDP client.
   - Establish communication parameters such as IP addresses and ports.

3. **Integration with Ethernet Switch**
   - Connect the FPGA to the 5-Port Gigabit Ethernet Switch for communication.

4. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Implement test cases to ensure proper functioning.
   - Debug any issues that arise during testing.

## Next Steps

Once the FPGA UDP Client is successfully implemented and tested, the focus will shift to developing the UDP Server on the Macbook. Stay tuned for the next blog post in this series as we explore the intricacies of setting up the UDP Server using CLion on the Macbook Pro.
