# What I learned at Parallax AV Design 

## How I met Bruce Levy (The CEO but he prefers to say he works for the company)

During my tenure as an alcohol pourer and gourmet grilled cheese craftsman at a beer and spot on the north shore of Long Island, I met a man named Bruce. Well, actually, I served him. And I couldn't tell you what he got but it was definetly beer.

I was perhaps a semester or two away from completing my degree in Computer Engineering and obviously I did not want to be smelling like cheese all day. Although the draft beer may have there. Anyways, I was looking to set myself up with engineering work before I even got my diploma. It was tough times post the pandemic.

When I saw this man on his laptop, working on some type of software I had never seen before (It looked like a more colorful version of the PLC programming I saw at other job). I took the opportunity to put my name out there. We exchanged info, spoke, and I didn't speak to him for another year...

After I graduated and subsequently left my internship, I felt sort of lost and hungry. So I reached out to Bruce and we scheduled a meeting at job-site. Somewhere in Midtown, my first job with Bruce
